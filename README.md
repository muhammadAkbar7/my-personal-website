# My Personal Website

### Description

Made this website for my CS 290: Web Devlopment Class at Oregon State.

### Overview

To use, simply clone the github repo, open terminal in code editor and type in 'npm start'. The webite will launch on the local machine (address is given in the terminal).

## Updates

Update 1:

Features that have been built so far:
- Designed a page to explain Web Devolopment concepts I learned in class and a gallery to showcase my adventures and other CS projects.

- Made a page processes data from an HTML form using Node, Express, and some JavaScript. The form will allow me to send confirmation e-mails based on the user data input using the Nodemailer package and Ethereal testing server.

- Made a page called Order, which displays the contents of a data file in an HTML table. It will also allow users to order a single product from that table, process the form data using Express routes and server-side JavaScript.

Update 2:

Added a new Staff page of randomly-generated users to existing website. This page will fetch data from an external API called Random User GeneratorLinks to an external site., which serves fake user data for the purposes of testing. The data will display in an HTML table after clicking a button to fetch the data. In addition, a success message will display with the API is working and a failure message when it is not.
