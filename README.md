## Updates

Update 1:

Features that have been built so far:
- Designed a page to explain Web Devolopment concepts I learned in class and a gallery to showcase my adventures and other CS projects.

- Made a page processes data from an HTML form using Node, Express, and some JavaScript. The form will Send the user data input to an email testing site using the Nodemailer package and Ethereal testing server.

- Made a page called Order, which displays the contents of a data file in an HTML table. It will also allow users to order a single product from that table, process the form data using Express routes and server-side JavaScript.
